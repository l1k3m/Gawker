About
=====

Gawker is an application for Mac OS X that creates time-lapse movies using a webcam. Images from
your camera can be shared, allowing other users to record your image stream. Streams can also be
combined to create a time-lapse movie with up to four locations side-by-side.

------------

I haven't been actively working on Gawker for a few years now, but I figured I would put it up on GitHub to make it
easier for people to fork and contribute.
